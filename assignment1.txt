I am interested in taking CMSC320 because data science is extremely useful and 
versatile. Data management and statistical analysis are vital skills in not just
computer science backend work, but in any area of research. I hope to formally 
learn about these topics and get an introduction to machine learning through 
this course, as well as become familiar with using SQL and the pandas library.
